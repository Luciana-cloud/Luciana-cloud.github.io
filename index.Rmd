title: "Data model integration across scales "
---

My name is Luciana Chavez Rodriguez. I am a Peruvian environmental soil modeler that aims to connect data to models across different scales. The main topics that define my work so far are: 

- *Complex systems*: I mainly model microbiological processes in soils, which are complex systems. 
- *Mathematical modeling*: I used mechanistic and statistical models to understand biogeochemical and biological processes occurring in soils.
- *Data scavenging*: I team up with experimentalists to help with data interpretation.
